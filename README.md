#TodoVentanas Management
In this repositorie, i will develop an python program with Tkinter.

*Calculate prices,
*Calculate costs,
*Order management,
*etc.

first of all, we need to import tkinter

In python shell:
*import tkinter
*immport _tkinter

if everything is ok, I can see a small window with this code:
tkinter._test()
